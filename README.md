create a vector class and analyze the runtimes of its functions.

#### a2. 

write code for various sorting algorithms. analyze the runtimes of the different algorithms on various sets of increasing, decreasing, and random data.

#### a3. 

create a program that can work with sparse matrices using vectors and doubly linked lists. analyze the runtimes of its functions.

#### a4. 

create a program that can create and print out a binary tree from an input file as well as perform insert and remove operations on it. analyze the runtimes of the operations.

#### a5.
